Non Localized Text.
<!-- tooltip end -->
This inspection reports inline text and certain HTML attributes that contain supposedly language-specific text
that is not overridden with localized text using the appropriate Thymeleaf attributes.
<br/>
The solution is to add a <b>th:text</b>/<b>th:placeholder</b> that refers to a localized message string.
