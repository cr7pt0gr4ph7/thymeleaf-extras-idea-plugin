Hardcoded Resource URL.
<!-- tooltip end -->
This inspection reports HTML tags like &lt;form/&gt;, &lt;a/&gt;, &lt;script/&gt; and &lt;link/&gt; that contain a
<b>src</b>, <b>href</b> or <b>action</b> attribute using a relative path to refer to application resources, so that the
resource files won't be found when viewing the application on the server.
<br/>
The solution is to add a <b>th:src</b>/<b>th:href</b>/<b>th:action</b> attribute so that the reference also works on the server.
