Hardcoded Resource URL.
<!-- tooltip end -->
This inspection reports &lt;script/&gt; and &lt;link/&gt; tags that contain a <b>src</b> or <b>href</b> attribute
using a relative path to refer to application resources, so that the resource files won't be found when viewing
the application on the server.
<br/>
The solution is to add a <b>th:src</b>/<b>th:href</b> attribute so that the reference also works on the server.
